## Reviewer support

The add-on can also display **Text Tools** in the reviewer right-click menu. Most reviewer-side features are available when [**Edit Field During Review (Cloze)**](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385888438) is installed.

Reviewer support was the original motivation behind the development of this add-on.

## Config

Open:

> Tools → Add-ons → Text Tools in Right-Click Menu → Config

The configuration window has three tabs:

- **General** — show **Text Tools** in the editor and/or reviewer right-click menu
- **Quick Items** — choose frequently used items and optionally display them at the top level of the right-click menu
- **User Words** — add, edit, remove, reorder, import, or export your own words and optionally display them at the top level of the right-click menu
